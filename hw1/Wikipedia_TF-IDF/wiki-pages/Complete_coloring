In graph theory, complete coloring is the opposite of harmonious coloring in the sense that it is a vertex coloring in which every pair of colors appears on at least one pair of adjacent vertices. Equivalently, a complete coloring is minimal in the sense that it cannot be transformed into a proper coloring with fewer colors by merging pairs of color classes. The achromatic number (G) of a graph G is the maximum number of colors possible in any complete coloring of G.

Finding (G) is an optimization problem. The decision problem for complete coloring can be phrased as:

Determining the achromatic number is NP-hard; determining if it is greater than a given number is NP-complete, as shown by Yannakakis and Gavril in 1978 by transformation from the minimum maximal matching problem.[1]

Note that any coloring of a graph with the minimum number of colors must be a complete coloring, so minimizing the number of colors in a complete coloring is just a restatement of the standard graph coloring problem.

For any fixed k, it is possible to determine whether the achromatic number of a given graph is at least k, in linear time.[2]

The optimization problem permits approximation and is approximable within a approximation ratio.[3]

The NP-completeness of the achromatic number problem holds also for some special classes of graphs: bipartite graphs,[2] complements of bipartite graphs (that is, graphs having no independent set of more than two vertices),[1] cographs and interval graphs,[4] and even for trees.[5]

For complements of trees, the achromatic number can be computed in polynomial time.[6] For trees, it can be approximated to within a constant factor.[3]

The achromatic number of an n-dimensional hypercube graph is known to be proportional to , but the constant of proportionality is not known precisely.[7]
